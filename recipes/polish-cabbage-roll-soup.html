        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chef Kevin's cabbage roll soup tastes exactly like traditional Polish-style dumplings.</p> 
        <p>It has all the same ingredients. This delicious and comforting one-pot soup satisfies the exact same craving, but involves a fraction of the work.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>3 cups tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 1/2 pounds green cabbage</li>
            <li>1 cup rice</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Set a soup pot over medium-high heat and melt butter. Add onion and salt, and cook, stirring, until onions turn soft and translucent, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef and cook, stirring and breaking up large clumps, until meat is browned and broken into small crumbles, about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Season with garlic, black pepper, cayenne, and bay leaf; cook and stir for 1 minute. Pour in beef broth, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Stir in cabbage, reduce heat to medium, and cook until cabbage is just tender, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in tomatoes and water, and continue to simmer, 10 to 15 minutes more. Stir in rice and half the parsley; simmer over medium heat until rice is tender and soup thickens, about 20 minutes. If soup becomes too thick as it simmers, add a little more beef broth and/or water. Season to taste with salt.</li>
        </ol>
